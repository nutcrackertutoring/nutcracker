Starting in 2011, I've been tutoring for 6 years now and loving every minute. I understand the material very well and can teach in both a fun and effective manner. I strive to know the material thoroughly and always try to further my own education to keep up with new and changing curriculums. <br><br>

I completed my VCE certificate and graduated from Melbourne High in 2010 with an ATAR of 99.45 and obtaining raw scores of 48 for Specialist Maths, 47 for Maths Methods and 47 for Physics.<br><br>

After high school I completed the Bachelor of Science majoring in Physics and minoring in Maths from Melbourne Uni graduating with first class honours. While completing my course I also obtained high distinctions for my physics, maths and chemistry subjects.<br><br>

Since I've been through the VCE system myself I know how it works and the pressures that come with it as well as tricks to get through it. I'm also close to the student's age so I know how they think and learn and can connect with them and teach them at the level that they would understand best. <br><br>

If you want to know more or want some tutoring don't hesitate to contact me, my contact details can be found <a href="{% url "contact" %}">here</a>.

<h2>Testimonials</h2>

<blockquote>
“Nathan has been absolutely fantastic for our son, he has improved his grades immensely. Noah just wishes he started tutoring earlier as Nathan has helped him really enjoy and understand year 12 Math and he was actually looking forward to the VCE maths exam!”<br>

<blockquote>
“Nathan tutored Rory through years 11 and 12 for maths methods, physics and chemistry VCE. 
Rory appreciated being able to bring  to these tutorials anything that he needed help with, from going over material they were covering at school, going through past papers to CAS calculator use. 
Nathan has a thorough understanding of the science and maths curriculum and how to teach it as well as modelling an approach to problem solving. 
From our perspective as parents we were really happy that Rory had Nathan as a resource and that having a clear and relaxed teaching and communication style with there were never issues about being sent there against his will.”<br>
