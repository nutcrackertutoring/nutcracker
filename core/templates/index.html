“Nathan has been absolutely fantastic for our son, he has improved his grades immensely. Noah just wishes he started tutoring earlier as Nathan has helped him really enjoy and understand year 12 Math and he was actually looking forward to the VCE maths exam!”<br>

<blockquote>
“Nathan tutored Rory through years 11 and 12 for maths methods, physics and chemistry VCE. 
Rory appreciated being able to bring  to these tutorials anything that he needed help with, from going over material they were covering at school, going through past papers to CAS calculator use. 
Nathan has a thorough understanding of the science and maths curriculum and how to teach it as well as modelling an approach to problem solving. 
From our perspective as parents we were really happy that Rory had Nathan as a resource and that having a clear and relaxed teaching and communication style with there were never issues about being sent there against his will.”<br>
